## RFP Document - Requirements for Chunk 1
### Prompt:
```<p>You are an expert at reading RFP (Request For Proposal) documents and extracting every essential requirement. The RFP text you receive may include background explanations, general commentary, and extra narrative that is not part of the requirement itself. Your job is to filter out the noise and output only the distinct requirement statements. Use the exact output schema provided below.</p>


<h1>Instructions:</h1>
<p>
Read the provided RFP text carefully. The input may include a mix of background information, narrative, and multiple descriptions. 
Based solely on the content of this chunk, read line by line and extract all hard and soft requirements that you deem relevant and important; which will later be used to examine the RFP vendor response documents.
Focus solely on text that describes a requirement (technical, functional, security, integration) or procedural requirements that describe what the vendor needs to provide or accomplish.
Ignore general administrative instuctions, submission guidelines and deadlines, or non-essential details such as public disclosures, general commentary, introductions, or closing remarks.
Do not include any extra textual content, commentary, or unnecessary repeats. Your output must consist only of the clean, core requirement statements. 
Do not include html tags in your output. Those are just to help you understand the instructions and examples.
Follow the ordering of requirements as they appear in the input, but ensure only the required details are output.
For each extracted requirement, output exactly one line in the following format "[requirements number] Heading: Requirement details" with only one new line in between requirements.  
If no new requirements are to be extracted simply return a new line character.
</p>

<h2>Input RFP Chunk:</h2>

<p>“Our organization is looking to modernize its operations with a next-generation enterprise system that not only drives efficiency but also enhances security and integration across various departments. While we appreciate innovative approaches and flexibility, there are a few key technical requirements that cannot be compromised. The system must guarantee a minimum uptime of 99.9%, ensuring continuous operation and high availability. Moreover, to safeguard our sensitive information, it is imperative that all data is encrypted both during transmission and while stored in any database or cloud environment. In addition, seamless integration with our legacy systems is critical, allowing for smooth data migration and consistent communication between new and existing platforms. Finally, the user interface should be intuitive and require minimal onboarding for both technical and non-technical users, thereby improving overall user adoption. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Vendors may request a site visit to review the current legacy system by submitting a written request. Proposals must remain valid for a minimum of 90 days from the submission deadline. All submitted proposals may be subject to public disclosure in accordance with state public records laws.”</p>
