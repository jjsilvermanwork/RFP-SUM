About Amtrak The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak, is a corporation striving to deliver a high quality, safe, on- time, and environmentally efficient rail passenger service that exceeds customer expectations. With 21,000 route miles in 46 states, the District of Columbia and three Canadian provinces, Amtrak operates more than 300 trains each day - at speeds up to 150 mph - to more than 500 destinations. Amtrak is the operator of choice for state- supported corridor services in 17 states and for four commuter rail agencies. ### 1.2. About Amtrak Information Technology (IT) At Amtrak, the information technology is both a strategic enabler of our business and a catalyst for innovation. The IT organization, led by Christian Zacariassen, delivers, operates, and maintains technology capabilities across all lines of business to ensure safety and security, provide a seamless customer experience, modernize fleet and train operations, empower a diverse, geographically dispersed yet connected workforce, support mega construction and infrastructure projects, and drive efficiency and financial excellence. Amtrak IT's vision is "To be a world-class IT team that proactively delivers secure, cost-effective business solutions that exceed the expectations of our business and customers." To help us reach the vision, we have developed a Technology Strategy that serves as the guidepost to inform how we align with the business vision and priorities, rank and deliver current strategic technology initiatives, and build an innovative new generation of Amtrak products and services. #### Amtrak Techology Strategy Business Alignment: <table> <tr> <th>Current State</th> <th colspan="2">Strategic Themes</th> <th colspan="2">2022 - 2023</th> <th colspan="2">2024-2026</th> <th>Future State</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Manual safety processes, limited real- time data, outdated APD/ Security systems and equipment</td> <td colspan="2">Safety and Security</td> <td colspan="2">· Safety Management System (SMS) Foundation · Mobile Document Compliance System (MDCS) · Safety Enhancements (SPARTN, Aware, Analytics) · APD/Security Upgrades (VSS, Radios, Cameras)</td> <td colspan="2">· SMS Expansion · MDCS Expansion · Predictive analytics · Enhancements (Aware, VSS)</td> <td>Data driven real-time awareness of safety issues, mobile-enabled workforce, modern equipment and systems</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Customers not informed of key information affecting their journey</td> <td colspan="2">Customer Experience</td> <td colspan="2">· Differentiated Customer Experience · Customer Notification and Service Change Management · Next Generation Kiosks · Food &amp; Beverage Next Gen POS · Customer Onboard WI-FI · PIDS 2.0</td> <td colspan="2">· Timely use of data to support a seamless journey · Use of gate, track and train information from operational systems to support accurate information provided to customers · Use of operational data to minimize disruption to customers and provide faster schedule recovery · Upgrade WI-FI to incorporate 5G cellular</td> <td>Customer awareness of all information related to their journey providing a superior customer experience</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Transitioning customer preferences in response to COVID-19 and shifting travel expectations</td> <td colspan="2">Revenue, Ridership and Transformation</td> <td colspan="2">· Pricing and Revenue Management · Inventory, Offer and Order Management · Customer Identification and AGR Transition · Voice Call Recording and Analytics</td> <td colspan="2">· Machine learning used to anticipate customer demand based on external factors</td> <td>Anticipation of customer trends allowing Amtrak to maximize yield per seat</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Legacy financial processes and systems hinder financial awareness, transparency and efficiency</td> <td colspan="2">Financial Visibility and Cost Discipline</td> <td colspan="2">· Revenue Accounting Improvements · Analytics Expansion (SCM, Finance) · Enterprise Timekeeping · Continuous Improvements (RPA/AI/ML) · Capital Lifecycle Mgt/Enterprise Project &amp; Portfolio Mgt</td> <td colspan="2">· Revenue Accounting Transformation · Advanced Analytics · ERP and legacy platform upgrade/optimization (S/4 HANA)</td> <td>Real-time financial insights, efficient processes, optimized cost structure, standardized timekeeping, transparent project/portfolio reporting</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Multiple employee systems are confusing, inefficient and do not support employee engagement</td> <td colspan="2">Connected Employee</td> <td colspan="2">· HR Information System Migration/Upgrade, employee self- service · Artificial Intelligence/Robotic Process Automation for Talent Acquisition · Enterprise Learning Mgt Platform (ELMP) on mobile devices · Continuous Improvements</td> <td colspan="2">· Analytics/data driven insights for HR processes · Rationalize legacy systems to core HRIS · Streamline and automate HR processes · Enhance digital engagement, simplify interface</td> <td>Engaged digital workforce, seamless and consistent employee interface, standard and efficient processes, real-time analytics, enhanced training platforms</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Inefficient, inconsistent and reactive processes; time-based maintenance, sub-optimal technology tools, limited analytics</td> <td colspan="2">Manage Transportation, Rail Operations and Assets</td> <td colspan="2">· Enterprise Asset Mgt - HSR/New Acela, ALC-42, Engineering · iLMS Expansion: CNOC Improvements; Incident Management · Train Control System Upgrades (Dispatch, PTC, PTSO, ET SCADA) · Advanced Analytics · IT/OT Convergence</td> <td colspan="2">· EAM expansion - Mechanical/Engineering, conditional maintenance · Unified Operations Center · Process Improvements/Automation (many) · Advanced Analytics · Emerging OT technologies</td> <td>Maximized safety, on-time performance and asset availability; optimized and efficient processes; timely analytical insights</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Existing trains provide limited information for customers and about train conditions.

Aligned with Amtrak and IT's strategic priorities, the SOO drives accountability and business partnerships, shortens time to market, and <!-- PageNumber="2" --> <!-- PageBreak --> <figure> AMTRAK </figure> enables flexibility and scale. A pivotal role within the SOO model is the IT Service Owner, who is responsible for a specific end-to-end technology service and value delivery, business relationship management, technology roadmap aligned with business objectives, service maturity, and performance metrics, among others. To augment employees and traditional procurement vehicles, IT contracts for a variety of products and services solicited through competitive and qualified bidding processes, such as master service agreements, fixed bid development services (packetized development), Center of Excellence (CoE), and subscription-based services. Master Services Agreement (MSA) - A contract entered into by Amtrak and its vendor(s) that outlines terms & conditions to govern future task-orders or releases against the agreement. The estimated annual spend is $50.0M (excluding staff augmentation contractors). Managed Services - IT has engaged multiple managed services vendors who provide an end-to-end, managed technology service with contractual SLAs, typically on a fixed price basis. These services often include engineering, capital deployment, and ongoing operations services. The responsibility for managing these vendors falls to the IT Service Owner who is accountable for that specific technology platform. Examples include hosted Data Center Operations, Network services, IT Service Desk, 24x7 Incident Management & IT Operations Center, On-board Wi-fi operations, and others. Fixed Bid Development Services - Fixed Bid Development Services, also referred to as packetized development, support well-defined development activities with clear service level agreements (SLAs) and pre-defined milestones. The estimated annual spend is currently $14.0M but expected to increase in future years with new IT workload. CoE - The CoE function supports established technologies across all platforms. With a focus on Operations & Maintenance (O&M), the CoE structure is a critical component of Amtrak's overall Enterprise IT Support Model. The CoE follows Amtrak's ITIL based service management processes for Incident, Problem, and Change Management, utilizes Amtrak standard tools for all IT Service Management (ITSM) activities, and provides Tier 2 application support and minor enhancements. The total O&M contract value over a 3-year base period is $41.0M with potential extension. In addition, the CoE provides for short-term "burst" capacity resources to support Capital projects. Cloud-Based Services - We continue to drive cloud transformation to improve IT operational effectiveness, strengthen cybersecurity posture, reduce operational costs, and improve the ROI of technology investments. A key tenet of the cloud strategy is to utilize cloud-based services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (Saas), Infrastructure as Code (laC), and Dev/Sec/Ops to deliver capabilities that meet Amtrak's needs. Cloud based computing capabilities are also a critical component of our IT Disaster Recovery & Resiliency Strategy. ### 1.3. Background The passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides unprecedented levels of investment for intercity passenger rail. The IIJA includes one-time funding of $66 billion in advance appropriations for intercity passenger and freight rail over five years, and reauthorization of federal rail policies with updates to the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The IIJA funding supplements the annual appropriations that Amtrak receives each fiscal</p>
